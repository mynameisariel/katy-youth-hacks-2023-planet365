# Planet365_app

## Inspiration

This is the app that was created for the NorcalHacks EduSands Hackathon. This project was inspired by the idea that the world can be changed through consistent, daily habits. As a young adult who wants to better the world for the future generations, climate change and the environment is one of the most prominent issues. This problem encompasses both social aspects and environmental aspects. The app I created focuses on society's daily lifestyle and attempts to address the problems in people's everyday actions. It is inspired loosely by habit tracker apps and mindfulness apps such as Mindset and Todoist.

## What it does

There are two main parts of this app:

**ACT**

- This page provides a daily prompt for the user to accomplish.
- The prompt is typically a small habit or lifestyle change that helps the environment in a specific way.
- There are further descriptions of how this action can specifically help combat climate change and a place to check off the accomplishment for the day.
- There are currently 31 prompts available in the app, and it cycles through a different action each day of the month.

**LEARN**

- This page consists of a library of information for the user to explore various topics relating to climate change and educate themselves on these topics.
- Many of these topics relate to awareness on social problems caused by climate change as well as education on how people can be more environmentally-friendly in their everyday lives.
- There are currently only two topics that are available to learn more on, however titles were provided for more topics to be expanded on.

## How I built it

This app was build with the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7jwlAdEnxVp5-90ODMhUwawUXVW9voYbsZU03B1jkuA5hy-L7oBsJRoChZUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) framework. It was launched using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7sh9y9FZvyDRZqst6ZYj2FhXlrtzS_Jzt4dkYO7LOrbPdY0Jtbfp3RoCXhgQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

Going into this hackathon, I was a complete beginner with the Flutter toolkit as well as the language used by it called Dart. Using online tutorials and experimenting on my own, I was able to familiarize with the various functionalities of this framework. This project was successful thanks to a number of resources:

## Challenges I ran into

There were definitely a variety of challenges that occurred as I was creating this project.

- **Timeline**: Due to the fact that I found out about this hackathon late, I was not able to spend as much time as I would have liked on this project. As a result, there are some features from my initial plan that I did not have time to add. I was also challenged by the changing deadlines on Devpost. The initial deadline was July 30th 12AM, so it was surprising and shocking when it changed to July 29th 12 AM.
- **Launching the web app**: Being my first ever web app that I developed, I was confused on how I could launch and publish it for the public to view. Thankfully many resources online pointed me towards Firebase. However, installing the required toolkits to launch it successfully was still a bit of a struggle.
- **Consistency between devices**: Due to the fact that I primarily designed my app for web use, it was definitely difficult to transfer the same and design to a different device. On different screens sizes, my app will appear different.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

In general, I am quite proud of completing this project for my first hackathon. I learned the framework and language within a short time to develop this web app. I am extremely proud of how cohesive everything is.

- **The "LEARN" page**: This page required extensive research on layouts in the "grid" format. In the end I was able to adjust everything as well as the images in a cohesive and aesthetic manner. Using the knowledge from when I first built this page, I was able to also build other grid layouts on other pages.
- **Daily prompts**: I really love my idea with changing prompts daily. It switches each day since it takes the date using the Datetime library. I am proud of myself for figuring this out.
- **Interface navigation**: I spent lots of time on many of the small aspects in my webpage that make the user navigation very smooth and easy. For instance, the dialog alerts and the tooltips are certain things that make the page very cohesive. I like the detailed result of my web app.

## What I learned

I learned a lot about coding with the Flutter framework as well as launching a web app to public. This experience really gave me lots of insight on developing apps in a more professional way. Because of this, I definitely want to build more apps in the future and expand my reach to mobile apps. I also learned about productivity and time management while working on my project, Time management was one big challenge that I ran into, so I learned that I should definitely sign up for hackathons earlier in the future.

## What's next for Planet365

Planet365 still has many features that are yet to be developed. The following are features that I would love to implement for my app in the future:

- **Tracking accomplishments**: The ability for the user to track their accomplishments (or keep a streak) for a more rewarding experience and to further motivate them to take action.
- **More LEARN pages**: I have many more ideas on topics to add to the LEARN page to help educate the user and raise awareness on climate change issues.
- **COMMUNITY page**: It would be amazing if Planet365 had a community page so that users could come together and talk about issues. This would further cultivate action and planning to better the planet.
- **Mobile development**: I would love for Planet365 to be an app that would work on mobile devices, not just the computer. I would also have to change the interface a little to fit the needs and the sizes of a narrow mobile screen.

## Conclusion

This hackathon was an extremely rewarding experience. I hope that my submission still counts even though I submitted it late. I am very proud of what I created and I hope that you enjoy Planet365 as well.
